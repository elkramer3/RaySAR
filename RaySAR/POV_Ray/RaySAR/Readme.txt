Note: This exe file is derived by compiling the adapted POV-Ray 3.7 source code. Recompiling the code is only necessary
if the code of the ray tracing process is changed, e.g. in order to add further signal reflection levels beyond 5 or export
further information into the text file Contributions.txt. If this is not the case, just use the existing exe file for your 
work.
